##Description for Yahoo HackU


hi guyzz!!!dis izz a hack 4 hacku....! . .

Frustrated by such comments all over the internet? Fear not, GrammarNazi is here!

GrammarNazi is a browser extension that replaces ugly looking sentences on webpages (like the one above) with their well-punctuated, grammatically correct equivalents. Poorly formatted text, often to be found in emails, chatrooms and on forums, can be quite exasperating. But while you can't control what people type, you can control what you read. Make every page look classy. Be a GrammarNazi

Our project for HackU 2013, IIT Kharagpur.
